# ðŸ“˜ Library Management API

The **Library Management API** is a backend service designed to manage library systems efficiently. It provides endpoints for handling **users**, **books**, **authors**, and their associations, while ensuring security with **JWT authentication** and one-time tokens for critical actions.

## Features Overview

### 1. **Efficient User Management**
   - **Registration & Authentication**: Secure sign-ups and log-ins for users.
   - **Role-based Access**: Different levels of access based on user roles (admin, user, etc.).
   - **Account Management**: Users can update and manage their personal account information.

### 2. **Library Book Operations**
   - **Add & Update Books**: Seamless book management with easy options to add, modify, or remove books from the library.
   - **Detailed Book Information**: Store and retrieve comprehensive details such as title and book ID.

### 3. **Author Management**
   - **Author Profiles**: Create and manage author profiles including name, and linked books.
   - **Track Author Contributions**: Keep a record of each authorâ€™s books in the library system.

### 4. **Book-Author Connections**
   - **Relationship Mapping**: Automatically link authors to their respective books in a clear, easy-to-understand format.
   - **Manage Associations**: Easily add or remove book-author relationships as needed.

### 5. **Secure API Endpoints**
   - **Token Authentication**: Secure access to all API endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
   - **One-Time Use Tokens**: Added security for sensitive operations, ensuring tokens cannot be reused for malicious purposes.

## Robust Security Measures

### **JWT Token Authentication**
   - Every API request is secured using **JWT tokens**. These tokens ensure that only authenticated users can perform operations within the API.
   - Protects user accounts, books, and author data from unauthorized access.

### **One-Time Use Tokens for Critical Actions**
   - For actions such as adding, updating, or deleting resources (users, books, authors), the system generates **one-time tokens** to prevent replay attacks.
   - Tokens are valid only for a short duration or for a single operation, minimizing security risks.

### **Data Integrity with Input Validation**
   - **Strong Validation Rules**: Ensures all user input is thoroughly validated to prevent the insertion of invalid or malicious data.
   - Checks for the presence of required fields, correct formats (e.g., email format, password strength), and unique values for critical fields (e.g., book title or author name).
